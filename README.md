 Data-Analysis  
A data-analysis project by Prince Ray.

🧠 Project Overview  
This repository contains code and resources for analyzing datasets to derive insights, visualizations and actionable conclusions. It demonstrates usage of JavaScript (and possibly other languages/tools), and is intended as a practice project to build analytical skills and develop portfolio work.

 ✅ Key Features  
- Ingest and clean raw datasets.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): summary statistics, distribution checking, correlations, trends.  
- Generate visualizations to highlight patterns and relationships.  
- Produce a summary of findings and recommendations based on the analysis.

 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** JavaScript (primary)  
- Other tools/libraries (to be filled in): e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Node.js, etc.  
- Workflow: Git + GitHub for version control.

 📁 Repository Structure 
 
├── data/               ← Raw and cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/          ← (Optional) Jupyter or other notebooks for EDA
├── src/                ← Source code for analysis and visualizations
├── output/             ← Generated charts, reports, tables
└── README.md           ← This file

 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Princeray-18/Data-Analyis.git

2. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the analysis script(s):

   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```
4. View outputs in `/output` or open generated visualizations in your browser.

 📌 Usage Notes

* Ensure you have the required version of Node.js (or other runtime) installed.
* If adding new datasets, place them in the `data/` folder and update the code accordingly.
* Customise the scripts to suit different dataset formats or analysis goals.

 🧩 Future Enhancements

* Support multiple data formats (CSV, JSON, API).
* Add more complex statistical modelling (regression, classification).
* Improve visualization interactivity or export functionality.
* Write automated tests for data processing modules.
